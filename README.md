# Jumpstart Suave on .NET Core

A minimal example of a project setup of a web application implemented with Suave and F#, on .NET Core.

To start up the web app, simply clone the repo, and execute the following commands.

```
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

This sample repo accompanies my [blog post about getting started with Suave on .NET Core](https://blog.markvincze.com/jumpstart-f-web-development-f-with-suave-io-on-net-core/).
